## Purpose
CableTrack PRO is the premier tool to enable electricians to quickly and easily create cable schedules for their projects. It allows the tracking of the cable meta-data, pull-ins, terminations, and tests.

 <br>

## Milestones
CableTrack PRO development is managed via Milestone projects and the issues they contain.

 <br>

## M1
In Milestone 1, we concentrated on laying out foundational functionality, primarily the components that will be used to create the pages.

<br>

## M2
In Milestone 2, we will be putting together the pages utilizing the components created during M1. This should lead to a second round of page development where we refactor the code for reusability.

<br>

## M3
In Milestone 3, we will be instrumenting the code with tests and adding documentation.

<br>

## Deployment
DigitalOcean

<br>

## Features
Company Branding
CableTrack PRO allows you to brand the application with your company logo. This allows the customer to present a professional image to their clients.

<br>

## Projects
CableTrack PRO allows you to create projects and add cables to them. You can then report progress by project.

<br>

## Cables
CableTrack PRO allows you to create cables and add them to projects. You can then track the progress of each cable.

## Contribution
My role in this build was to focus on the Company pages and testing, in addition to a Companies page. Because of the structure of the roles, it was not difficult to restrict access to these pages after login. Only the administrative role is able to access the Companies page, while all other roles access the company page associated with their company. Company identification is a vital aspect of this project because it was the identifying key after login to access Projects, cables, and user information.

## Educational Outcome
Through building CableTrackPro, I learned how nuanced GitHub can be when working in a group. There were multiple instances where I committed, but I did not push my changes, which were then lost. Communicating the appropriate time to push changes was particularly important towards the end of this build since there were still many changes being made.
