## Purpose
CableTrack PRO is a tool which enables electricians to quickly and easily create cable schedules for their projects. It allows the tracking of the cable meta-data, pull-ins, terminations, and tests.

 <br>

## Milestones
CableTrack PRO development is managed via Milestone projects and the issues they contain.

 <br>

## [<ins style="color: black">M1</ins>](https://github.com/orgs/ingeniouspartners/projects/1)
In Milestone 1, we concentrated on laying out foundational functionality, primarily the components that will be used to create the pages.

<br>

## [<ins style="color: black">M2</ins>](https://github.com/orgs/ingeniouspartners/projects/2)
In Milestone 2, we put together the pages utilizing the components created during M1. This lead to a second round of page development where we refactored the code for reusability.

<br>

## [<ins style="color: black">M3</ins>](https://github.com/orgs/ingeniouspartners/projects/3)
In Milestone 3, we instrumented the code with tests and added documentation.

## Contribution
My role in this build was to focus on the Company pages and testing, in addition to a Companies page. Because of the structure of the roles, it was not difficult to restrict access to these pages after login. Only the administrative role is able to access the Companies page, while all other roles access the company page associated with their company. Company identification is a vital aspect of this project because it was the identifying key after login to access Projects, cables, and user information.
