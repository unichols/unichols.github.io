## Purpose
CableTrack PRO is the premier tool to enable electricians to quickly and easily create cable schedules for their projects. It allows the tracking of the cable meta-data, pull-ins, terminations, and tests.

## Milestones
CableTrack PRO development is managed via Milestone projects and the issues they contain.

## M1
In Milestone 1, we concentrated on laying out foundational functionality, primarly the components that will be used to create the pages.

## M2
In Milestone 2, we will be putting together the pages utilizing the components created during M1. This should lead to a second round of page development were we refactor code for reusability.

## M3
In Milestone 3, we will be instrumenting the code with tests and adding documentation.

## Deployment
DigitalOcean
