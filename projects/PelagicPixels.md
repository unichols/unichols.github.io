 <h1> 🎯 Purpose</h1>
</div>
<div class="col-lg-9 container1">
**Pelagic Pixels** is a cutting-edge synthetic data generation pipeline designed to address the scarcity of real-world data for marine object detection. By combining 3D model animations with authentic underwater footage, Pelagic Pixels enables the training of AI models to accurately identify rare and protected marine species, such as sea turtles, rays, and sharks, in an ethical and scalable manner.

## 🌟 Features
<div class="col-lg-9 container1">
- **Ethical Data Collection:** Leverages synthetic data to eliminate the need for intrusive real-world data collection of protected species.
- **Advanced Augmentation:** Incorporates variations in lighting, orientation, size, and color to create a robust and diverse dataset.
- **Scalability:** Designed to generate large-scale datasets efficiently, facilitating extensive AI training without ethical concerns.
</div>
<br>

## 🤝 Contribution
<div class="col-lg-9 container1">
As a key contributor to **Pelagic Pixels**, my focus has been on developing the augmentation module and ensuring seamless integration with underwater footage. This involved:
- **Augmentation Development:** Implemented randomized adjustments for lighting, color, and size to enhance data realism.
- **Integration:** Merged species-specific animations with diverse underwater environments.
- **Automation:** Developed automated process for generating large amounts of synthetic data.

This role required both technical expertise and a commitment to ethical data practices, ensuring that our pipeline remains both effective and responsible.
