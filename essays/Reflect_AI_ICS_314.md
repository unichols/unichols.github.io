## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized various aspects of our lives, including education. In my software engineering journey, AI has emerged as a powerful tool that enhances my learning experience, fosters my problem-solving capabilities, and promotes critical interactions with technology. Throughout this course, I have had the opportunity to explore and utilize a range of AI tools, such as ChatGpt and Co-Pilot, which have played a pivotal role in shaping my understanding of software engineering concepts and building practical skills.

## Personal Experience with AI

In my software engineering journey, I have encountered several AI tools that have greatly influenced my learning experience. One such tool is ChatGpt, an AI-powered chatbot that acts as a virtual mentor, providing instant feedback and guidance on coding challenges. ChatGpt has been helpful in understanding complex concepts and exploring different approaches to problem-solving, some of which resemble good, and bad, coding practices. Additionally, I have had the privilege of using Co-Pilot, an AI-powered code completion tool, which integrates directly into my IDE, IntelliJ. Co-Pilot suggests code snippets, predicts the next lines of code, and assists in automating repetitive tasks. Its intelligent code suggestions have not only accelerated my coding process but have also exposed me to new programming patterns and techniques, in a way that is frequently more accurate than ChatGPT.

## Impact on Learning and Understanding

In general, these tools have assisted me positively throughout this course. Co-Pilot is a much more trustworthy tool to use compared to ChatGPT, which is often incorrect. When using ChatGPT, I had to spend a significant amount of time verifying I was asking an accurate question. Rather than expect ChatGPT to be correct, it was important I asked the generative AI questions with some foreknowledge it is likely to be wrong. With this in mind, it was ever more critical to provide ChatGPT with as many details as possible to structure the query. Being able to use ChatGPT deeply improved my question-asking skills, in the same way that Co-Pilot helped me build more practical skills. 

## Practical Applications

In terms of practicality, while ChatGPT falls short, Co-Pilot pulls through. The code suggestions and code completion features helped me complete lines of code more quickly and accurately. The suggestions provided were almost always relevant, which saved me time and reduced the likelihood of syntax errors. Because of this, Co-Pilot allowed me to focus on more complex aspects of my projects giving me more time for problem-solving, and should be suggested for real-life software engineering problems

## Challenges and Opportunities

As stated previously, most issues with generative AI I had revolved around ChatGPT. I would not consider it as much of a challenge as it was an opportunity to condition myself to ask better questions to technology. All of the Chat-GPTs inaccuracies were a reminder that it is quite literally a little baby, and a chance to practice patience.

## Comparative Analysis

The ease of access to generative AI following the COVID-19 pandemic provided an opportunity for more individuals to engage in computer science, whether it be academically or personally. Compared to traditional teaching methods, an AI-enhanced approach offers significant advantages in terms of engagement and practical skill development, while slightly taking away from the knowledge retention that is built by traditional methods. The integration of AI empowers students with less experience to bridge the gap between theories learned in the ICS program at UH, and practice. 

## Future Considerations

The changing landscape of academia due to COVID-19 caused a polar reaction to the introduction of generative AI, where either educators ban it completely, or try to accept that this may be part of a new academic change here to stay. I personally think that generative AI could be much more helpful to instructors than to students, as too often educators in the public sector are far underpaid and overworked. Generating lesson plans each semester or school year depending on the level of learning would significantly decrease the time teachers spend working off the clock. 

## Conclusion 

The integration of AI tools, such as ChatGpt and Co-Pilot, in my software engineering education, has been transformative. These tools have not only enhanced my learning experience but have also expanded my problem-solving capabilities and increased my confidence. As AI continues to evolve, I am excited about the possibilities it holds for the future of software engineering education, empowering learners like me to become more proficient, innovative, and adaptive in this dynamic field.
