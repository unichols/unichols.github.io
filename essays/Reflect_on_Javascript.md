## Experiencing javascript after C

Learning javascript has given me a greater appreciation for the required prerequisite C and Java classes. Because javascript is a C-style language, it uses similar syntax to C, such as assignment operators and use of "{}". Syntacitcal knowledge of C-style languages has made it easier to apply concepts from C that Javascript excels in such as inheritance. In C, a reference to the base object must be mainained by the derived object. Javascripts ability to manipulate and assign properties to objects makes inheritance unnessecary. Javascript even allows functions to exist as objects, which provides additional convenience. 

Personally, the ease of use of javascript has been a breath of fresh air. I was defensivley ready to experience "the joy of C" again, and am happy to say that using this language seems a little bit more joyful, in a non ironic sense. The practice WODs, even though I happened to miss those on discord, were helpful and instilled a little confidence. I was concerned I would feel very out of my league, but I realized I need to spend less brain time worrying and more thinking.
