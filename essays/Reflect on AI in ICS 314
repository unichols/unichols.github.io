## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized various aspects of our lives, including education. In my software engineering journey, AI has emerged as a powerful tool that enhances my learning experience, fosters my problem-solving capabilities, and promotes critical interactions with technology. Throughout this course, I have had the opportunity to explore and utilize a range of AI tools, such as ChatGpt and Co-Pilot, which have played a pivotal role in shaping my understanding of software engineering concepts and building practical skills.

## Personal Experience with AI

In my software engineering journey, I have encountered several AI tools that have greatly influenced my learning experience. One such tool is ChatGpt, an AI-powered chatbot that acts as a virtual mentor, providing instant feedback and guidance on coding challenges. ChatGpt has been helpful in understanding complex concepts, explore different approaches to problem-solving, some of which resemble good, and bad, coding practices. Additionally, I have had the privilege of using Co-Pilot, an AI-powered code completion tool, which integrates directly into my IDE, IntelliJ. Co-Pilot suggests code snippets, predicts the next lines of code, and assists in automating repetitive tasks. Its intelligent code suggestions have not only accelerated my coding process but have also exposed me to new programming patterns and techniques, in a way which is frequently more accurate than ChatGPT.

## Impact on Learning and Understanding

In general, these tools have assisted me positivley throughout this course. Co-Pilot is a much more trustworthy tool to use compared to ChatGPT, which is often incorrect. When using ChatGPT, I had to spend a significant amount of time verifying I am asking an accurate question. Rather than expect ChatGPT to be correct, it was important I asked the generative AI questions with some foreknowledge it is likely to be wrong. With this in mind, it was ever-more critical to provide ChatGPT with as many details as possible to structure the query. Being able to use ChatGPT deeply improved my question-asking skills, in the same way which Co-Pilot helped me build more practical skills. 

## Practical Applications

In terms of practicality, while ChatGPT falls short, Co-Pilot pulls through. The code suggestions and code completion features helped me complete lines of code more quickly and accurately. The suggestions provided were almost always relevant, which saved me time and reduced the liklihood of syntax errors. Because of this, Co-Pilot allowed me to focus on more complex aspects of my projectsm giving me more time for problem solving.
