I have very little software engineering experience, and hope to come out of this course much more confident. As of now, I have a Pokemon GUI which may be considered a software engineering project, but besides that I run dry. I do work for the UH Website, and maintaining the WordPress page has opened my eyes as to how many layers go into creating a webpage. I hope that after this class, I may have enough literacy in development to work on projects that interest me.

I would love to improve the Hawaiian Dictionary website, wehewehe.org. I have used this site practically since in came to be in the early 2000ʻs, and would love the chance to improve its user interface, as well as participate in adding more information into their database. Right now, it is a little difficult for a user to use this dictionary because it requires precise sytax of ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi. For example, if I was reading the Hawaiian newspaper and wanted to look up what maikaʻi meant, I must type in exactly the charachters needed, the m, a, i, k, a, ʻ, and i. If any of these charecters are ommitted, there will be no result. I would love to improve this, and provide better suggestions for a user who may be looking at a word from a newspaper printed over 100 years ago, back when the ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi written languge restricted to standard english charecters because of the printing presses used. 

Just because I may not nessecarily have adequate experience to confidently develop projects I am interested in, Iʻm sure that by winter I will be much better prepared. On reddit, there are extremely high reveiws of this class, one user described this class and the class that made them actually feel like they could complete a project. I am hoping that I will get this result as well.
