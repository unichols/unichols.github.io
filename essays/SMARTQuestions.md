According to Eric Raymond, to ask a SMART quesion, you must first address the following: 

Try to find an answer by searching the archives of the forum or mailing list you plan to post to.

Try to find an answer by searching the Web.

Try to find an answer by reading the manual.

Try to find an answer by reading a FAQ.

Try to find an answer by inspection or experimentation.

Try to find an answer by asking a skilled friend.

If you're a programmer, try to find an answer by reading the source code.

When asking this question, Raymond suggests NOT to do the following:

Post your question to a forum where it's off topic

Post a very elementary question to a forum where advanced technical questions are expected, or vice-versa

Cross-post to too many different newsgroups

Post a personal e-mail to somebody who is neither an acquaintance of yours nor personally responsible for solving your problem
