According to Eric Raymond, to ask a SMART quesion, you must first address the following: 

Try to find an answer by searching the archives of the forum or mailing list you plan to post to.

Try to find an answer by searching the Web.

Try to find an answer by reading the manual.

Try to find an answer by reading a FAQ.

Try to find an answer by inspection or experimentation.

Try to find an answer by asking a skilled friend.

If you're a programmer, try to find an answer by reading the source code.

On meta.stackoverflow, I found a thrilling question following the title, "Temporary policy: Generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT) is banned". When this discussion was opened nine months ago, users questioned why this ban was in place by asking chatGPT. These discussions have since been locked, but oh, is it amusing to read! 

The questions that the user asked chatGPT were, "why should stack overflow ban ai generated answers?" and "why should stack overflow allow ai generated answers?". The answers given to this user by generative AI demonstrated perfectly why stackoverflow decided to ban generative AI, with the answer to the first question logically providing reasosn why it shouldn ªt be included, then immediatley after almost refuting its claim when answering the second question. 

I thought that this was a funny example of a smart question because of how both questions literally provide solid reasoning on why generative AI was banned on stackoverflow. Because the user asked chatGPT both perspectives of this issue, and received answers affirming the choice to ban generative AI. Here is a link to that line of questioning: [Generative AI StackOverflow](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/421832)
