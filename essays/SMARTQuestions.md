## According to Eric Raymond, to ask a SMART question, you must first address the following:

Try to find an answer by searching the Web.

Try to find an answer by reading the manual.

Try to find an answer by reading a FAQ.

Try to find an answer by inspection or experimentation.

Try to find an answer by asking a skilled friend.

If you're a programmer, try to find an answer by reading the source code.

## AI banned on Stackoverflow?

On meta.StackOverflow, I found a thrilling question following the title, "Temporary policy: Generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT) is banned". When this discussion was opened nine months ago, users questioned why this ban was in place by asking chatGPT. These discussions have since been locked, but oh, is it amusing to read! 

The questions that the user asked chatGPT were, "Why should stack overflow ban ai-generated answers?" and "Why should stack overflow allow ai-generated answers?". The answers given to this user by generative AI demonstrated perfectly why Stackoverflow decided to ban generative AI, with the answer to the first question logically providing reasons why it shouldn ªt be included, then immediately after almost refuting its claim when answering the second question. 

I thought that this was a funny example of a smart question because of how both questions literally provide solid reasoning on why generative AI was banned on Stackoverflow. Because the user asked chatGPT both perspectives on this issue and received answers affirming the choice to ban generative AI. Here is a link to that line of questioning: [Generative AI StackOverflow](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/421832)

## Why ask Stackoverflow about hashtables?
On Stackoverflow, I found a horrible, broad question that does not fit the standard set by Eric Raymond as a smart question. The user asked stack overflow "How Does a Hashtable Work?", with no other applications. This is an example of a bad question because it skips the first few steps of asking a smart question and goes straight to asking the forum. 

Instead of asking Stackoverflow, the user who asked this question should have done their own research online. If that was not successful, the user's next step would be to read their textbook and get an acceptable answer that their professor will align with. If that is also unsuccessful, the user should have asked a friend in their peer group to provide a better explanation. 

This user luckily had many professionals respond to the question and provide paragraphs of details explaining the function, architecture, and issues of using a hash table. Here is a link to that line of questioning: [HashTable](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/730620/how-does-a-hash-table-work)
