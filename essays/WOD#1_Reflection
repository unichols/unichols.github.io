Write a little essay about your experience with the first WOD. Address the following questions:

1. What did you learn from preparing for and performing the WOD?
I learned I was gravley unprepared. I missed the online pracitce WODs and it showed in my confidence and overall performance last wednesday. 

2. What do you think you could do to improve your performance for the next WOD?
I will be attending all future practice WODs to hopefully get adjusted to the in class timed WOD. If I am more used to the format, I will have an easier time 
3. Was the experience valuable?

4. Discuss why you chose to implement the function the way you did and in-retrospect, if you would implement it differently and why (such as some of the things we discussed after the WOD).

5. Do you think it's important/valuable to discuss the WOD after its completed? Explain why or why not.
