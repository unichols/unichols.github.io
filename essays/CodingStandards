## Error Alert!

  So far, I have been quite enjoying ESLINT. One of the most frustrating things to happen when coding is to have code not produce results. Then, to add to the trouble, weird error messages popping up and having no clue what they mean. IntelliJ adds significant clarity in error messages, but can be overwhelming. ESLINT, with most other plugins un-plugged from intelliJ, is perfect for all intents and purposes. 

  As someone who does not really engage with computer science outside of academia, I had no knowledge of coding standards. After this past week, I am liking how it forces me to clean up my code. This, in turn, makes it much easier to debug my code. It takes me an hour to read and understand two pages of shakspeares Hamlet; the only reason reading my code takes slightly less time to understand is because I was the one who wrote it. Hopefully after getting used to ESLINT, it will be easier for me to interpret my own code, as well as the code of others.
