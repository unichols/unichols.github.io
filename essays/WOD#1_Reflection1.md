  After the first WOD I learned I was gravley unprepared. I missed the online pracitce WODs and it showed in my confidence and overall performance last wednesday. I will be attending all future practice WODs to hopefully get adjusted to the in class timed WOD. If I am more used to the format, I will have an easier time focusing on the problem at hand, rather than worrying about time. 

  My score on the WOD was an important reminder of how  this class functions. With these excersizes, there is no rooom for error, while on the other hand whie doing conceptual algorithm work, there is no need to go into the specifics of the code enough to care about minor code. Definitely, again, a reminder of how much more time I need to be putting into this class. 

  On this WOD, I need to improve on my attentiveness to my work and checking. When writing the code on the last WOD I implemented it from 1 to 100 but changed it to 1 to 15 when checking to make sure it worked.  Because I felt the pressure of time, I made the error of not changing my code back to its original form. Yes, in the same way that its nice to have feedback when writing papers. It better engages me in actually figuring out my errors and learning from them.
