## Difficulties 

When searching for websites to emulate as instructed to in assignment E36 for ICS 314, I was genuinley shocked at how many sites use bootstrap5. Although it made my search more difficult, it showed me just how valueable this UI framework is. Navigating the containers, especially containers within containers was particularly difficult when doing this weeks assignments. Sometimes, to change an element, I would get very confused wether it was appropriate to modify in the class, or just in the <bleh="meow"> tag. This confusion lead me down some time consuming rabbit holes of uncertainty.

## Strengths

Besides the difficulties, I found bootstrap5 to be helpful as I do not have much experience in HTML & CSS. Thus, there wasn ªt much for me to change in my coding habits, although I heard otherwise from classmates with more experience. Bootstrap5 cuts out time spent modifying margins and padding to be perfect, so we have more time and more fun customizing the UI.
